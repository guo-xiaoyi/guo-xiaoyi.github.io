-	When clicking on the link with the full instructions, I notice the following: 
o	Rename from “Full game instructions” to “Full instructions” or just “Instructions”
o	Rename “Experiment sessions” to “Sessions” (or, if you want to avoid having twice the same subtitle, to “Number of sessions”)
o	“ses-sions” -> “sessions”
o	“only in that case you will” -> “only in that case will you” [inversion needed – please check if we have the same sentence also in the regular instructions where it needs to be adjusted]
o	“risky payoff tree” -> “random payoff tree”
o	“Please close this page if you have already understood the instructions and go back to the experimental software.” Nothing speaks against them leaving the instructions open, right? We could thus say “You can go back to the experimental software by switching browser tabs or by closing these instructions.”
